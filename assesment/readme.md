API is set up to accept query params as detailed in Postman collection given.
The Hotelbeds API didn't recgonise any Authorization field and I unfortunately don't have the time to fully debug this given work + life commitments.
I'm happy to share code from previous projects with a similar principle to this and talk through it as I did this kind of API-for-API work when partnering with Airwallex.
Thanks
